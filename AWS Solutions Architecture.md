## Program Experience

I recently participated in the AWS virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be a Solutions Architect on the AWS team. I really enjoyed creating an architecture diagram and drafting a plain language email to explain how it works and how costs would be calculated to my client.

The realistic context helped me to understand how critical the relationship can be between the CTO of an early stage company and their Solutions Architect at AWS. I also learned how being thoughtful and considered as a Solutions Architect can significantly reduce the stress faced by clients.

Through this program I realized that I really enjoy working on designing hosting architecture and would love to apply what I've learned as a Solutions Architect at AWS.
