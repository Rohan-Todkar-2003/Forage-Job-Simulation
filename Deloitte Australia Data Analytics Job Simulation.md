I recently participated in Deloitte's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be part of the team at Deloitte.

I was able to analyse data and create a dashboard. I practised using Tableau and Excel and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context.
